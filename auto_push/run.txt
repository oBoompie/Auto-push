How to use it:


Save the file as auto_push.ps1 inside your project root.


Right-click the file → Run with PowerShell.


It will automatically:


Stage all changes


Commit them with the message "Auto-update: commit all changes"


Push to the main branch on GitHub





✅ Optional: You can double-click a shortcut to this script on your desktop for even quicker access.

If you want, I can make a more advanced version that:


Automatically detects your GitHub remote (or asks for it once)


Skips empty commits


Creates the remote repository via the GitHub API if it doesn’t exist


Do you want me to make that version?
